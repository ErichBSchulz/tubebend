# Tracheal Intubation Geometry Simulation

This project aims to illustrate the impact of bending a tube over the upper incisors while attempting tracheal intubation.

## Live Demo

You can see this page live and get more information [here](https://erichbschulz.github.io/tubebend/).

## Dev notes 

If you like you can save the html file and edit yourself in notepad.

I've aimed to make the code as accessible as possible.

### Optional local server

If you are familiar with `node` and `npm`  using these commands to run a server locally that refreshes the page as you save changes:

    npm run dev
